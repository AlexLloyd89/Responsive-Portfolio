<p>Thank your for taking the time to check out my page! My name is Alex Lloyd, and I am currently attending UNC's coding boot-camp to learn how to become a full-stack web developer. My desire to learn how to code comes from being a life-long gamer. I made a short first person adventure game, and wanted the opportunity to expand on my knowledge and "learn how to learn" coding.</p>

<p>Aside from gaming, in my free time I am a musician. I have played guitar and been in bands since I was in middle school. My most new found love for music comes in the form of audio engineering. I really enjoy the challenges of creating a sonic landscape from a blank canvas.</p>
